# Bank GoodCredit Classification Model 💳📈

This project focuses on predicting creditworthiness using machine learning techniques based on customer bank loan data.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- Binary classification: Predict whether a customer has good credit
- Preprocessing of structured tabular data
- Model building using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 📁 Files

- `PM-PR-0015_Bank GoodCredit_Model.ipynb`: Main notebook with data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
